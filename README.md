# Interactive Visualization

Interactive visualization is becoming a more prominent feature of reporting. Business analytics packages tend to stress the ease eith which data can be played with by non-experts. Allowing students to explore aspects of complex data rather than simply telling them what you see can be a powerful tool for learning as explored in the readings. Within the RStudio universe this functionality is accomplished through the Shiny ecosystem. A web-app designing interface that allows web-apps to be built from within R with limited knowledge of javascript or html.

## Goals

* Be familiar with the ways that data visualization can aid student learning
* Understand the structure of a Shiny App
* Be able to build a basic Shiny App to run locally on your machine
* Be able to explore interactive functionality within a Shiny App to convey a message about data

## Completed Tasks

I built a couple of basic Shiny Apps.  

* Histogram  
![Histogram](Visualization1.mov)  

* Ggplot Histogram 
![GGplot](Visualization2.mov)  

I then used the class mid-term data to create an interactive visualization that launches to the internet.
